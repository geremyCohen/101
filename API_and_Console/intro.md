# API and Console Access to AWS

When you make calls to AWS, you can do them in one of two ways:  1) Via Web Console, or 2) via an API Call.  (Under the covers, the web console is making API calls as well.)

## console

For beginners, the console is considered an easier way to navigate and get familiar with AWS.  To access the console, click on the AWS Web Console link at [https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com).

## API

Depending on your use case, your comfort level, as well as to access some features that may not be accessible via the console, direct API calls to AWS are another way to access AWS services.

The most common way to access AWS via API is through the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).  Another way to utilize the AWS API is via [SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

Use the best tool for the job -- if you are writing an application, one of the SDKs is probably the best method to communicate with AWS.  If you writing a script, the CLI may be the best way to go.
